# Moonland Metaverse

Moonland is a hybrid metaverse RPG that combines the living, player-driven economy of MMOs with innovative Web3 technologies. Built by the Moonland Dev team, the project features core systems such as movement, flying, player login, zone spawning, character selection, inventory, questing, and robust server infrastructure for early access and alpha testing.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Metaverse RPG**: Blends MMO gameplay with Web3, enabling a tokenized economy and decentralized assets.
- **Player-Owned Digital Real Estate**: All economic activities occur on player-owned land, which can be monetized through advertising, events, or DeFi services.
- **Play-to-Earn Mechanics**: Players can earn rewards via quests, territory control, guilds, mini-games, and unique business models like NFT property and digital shops.
- **Decentralized Economy**: Uses NFTs and the Moonland Token (MTK) for in-game items, with integrated DeFi pools, trading, and yield mechanics.
- **Entertainment & Social Hub**: Supports concerts, streaming, social spaces, and interactive community events for both gamers and non-gamers.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborates with leading blockchain and gaming entities (e.g., Qtum, Qorpo Gaming Studio, Crypto Oasis) to drive innovation and adoption.
- **Mini-games & Content Creation**: Players and advertisers can sponsor and participate in tournaments and custom games, with tools for content generation.

## Current Status
